My bar mitzvah website code

Linked to via a paperless post letter, RSVPs directly to mysqli.

1. `git init`
2. `git config user.name "sampdubs"`
3. `git config user.email "sammypw1@gmail.com"`
4. `git add [-A or file you want to add]`
5. `git commit -m "<messge for your commit>"`
6. `git remote add origin <http link for the repo>`
7. `git push -u origin <branch name in ()'s probably master>`
8. `Enjoy your beautiful github repo`
